# CollabCanvas Demo Script (4-5 minutes)

## Opening (20 seconds)

"I'm Tyler Pohn and this is my CollabCanvas - a real-time collaborative design tool with AI-powered canvas manipulation, built with React 19, TypeScript, Konva.js, Firebase, and OpenAI.

## Authentication & Security (25 seconds)

"We use Google OAuth with enterprise-grade security including Content Security Policy, XSS protection with DOMPurify, and rate limiting. Once you log in, your display name and avatar are immediately visible to other collaborators with secure session management.

_[Show login page, then switch to canvas - highlight security features in browser dev tools]_

## Core Canvas Features (60 seconds)

"Here's our main canvas interface with a large, infinite workspace featuring smooth pan and zoom at 60fps. We have a modern toolbar with comprehensive drawing tools.

_[Demo each tool: select, pan, rectangle, circle, text]_

The design palette on the right provides professional-grade styling controls. When I select a shape, I can see who last edited it and when - this is crucial for collaborative workflows.

_[Show design palette with object info, styling controls]_

## Advanced Design Features (45 seconds)

"The design palette includes comprehensive styling options:

- Fill and stroke colors with preset palettes
- Stroke width and corner radius controls
- Advanced text formatting with font family, size, weight, and alignment
- Line height and text decoration controls
- Layer management with bring forward/backward controls

_[Demonstrate text styling, color changes, layer management]_

All changes apply in real-time and are synchronized across all collaborators instantly.

## Real-Time Collaboration (60 seconds)

"The presence system shows live cursors with user names and avatars. Let me demonstrate by logging in on another device.

_[Demo multi-device login and collaboration]_

For conflict resolution, we show 'last edited by [name] at [time]' in the design palette, and the system automatically resolves conflicts using timestamp-based last-write-wins.

_[Show simultaneous editing, conflict resolution, design palette updates]_

Cursor tracking is throttled to 25ms via Firebase Realtime Database for smooth real-time feel, and object updates are debounced to 100ms for optimal performance.

## Productivity Features (30 seconds)

"CollabCanvas includes several productivity features:

- Keyboard shortcuts: Delete key to remove objects, Cmd+D to duplicate
- Arrow keys for precise 5-pixel nudging
- Double-click text to edit inline with live styling preview
- Multi-selection with bulk styling operations
- Persistent state - refresh the page and all work is preserved
- Health monitoring with connection status indicators

_[Demonstrate keyboard shortcuts, text editing, multi-selection, refresh to show persistence]_

## AI-Powered Canvas Manipulation (60 seconds)

"Now for the exciting part - our AI agent that can manipulate the canvas through natural language. Let me demonstrate by clicking the AI button in the toolbar.

_[Open AI panel and demonstrate natural language commands]_

Watch this - I can say 'create a red rectangle' and the AI will understand and execute the command, creating a red rectangle that appears for all users in real-time.

_[Demonstrate: "create a red rectangle", "make a blue circle", "add some text"]_

The AI uses OpenAI's gpt-4o-mini with function calling to understand natural language and convert it into precise canvas operations. It supports 19 different commands covering creation, manipulation, layout, and complex operations. (Note: LangChain agent implementation is not working)

_[Show sample command buttons and demonstrate complex commands]_

All AI-generated changes sync across all users instantly, just like manual operations. The AI understands context, uses proper color formats, and maintains the same real-time collaboration experience.

## Architecture & Performance (45 seconds)

"Under the hood, CollabCanvas uses a sophisticated architecture:

- React 19 with concurrent features and TypeScript for type safety
- Konva.js with WebGL acceleration for 60fps 2D rendering
- React Query provides optimistic updates and intelligent caching
- Custom ObjectSyncService bridges React Query with Firebase Firestore
- Zustand for lightweight state management
- MUI components with Material Design for accessibility
- DOMPurify for XSS protection and comprehensive input validation
- OpenAI GPT-4o-mini with function calling for natural language processing (LangChain agent not working)
- Rate limiting and security audit logging
- Debounced updates (100ms) and cursor throttling (25ms) via RTDB for optimal performance
- Last-write-wins conflict resolution with visual feedback in design palette

The system supports 500+ objects and 5+ concurrent users with enterprise-grade security and AI-powered canvas manipulation.
